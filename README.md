# arXiv Dataset Analysis and Discovery Tools 

arXiv Dataset: https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2020/08/05/leveraging-machine-learning-to-fuel-new-discoveries-with-the-arxiv-dataset/

A project to help explore arXiv research papers and fuel new scientific discovery.

I am interested to put a team together of people that are interested in exploring this dataset and report insights.

The second part of the project is to potentially build a discovery tool that supports semantic search capabilities.

In the end, I would like if we can build applications that help with paper recommendations and trend analysis.
