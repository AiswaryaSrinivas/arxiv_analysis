# arXiv Dataset Analysis and Discovery Tools 

arXiv Dataset: https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2020/08/05/leveraging-machine-learning-to-fuel-new-discoveries-with-the-arxiv-dataset/

A project to help explore arXiv research papers and fuel new scientific discovery.

I am interested to put a team together of people that are interested in exploring the [arXiv dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv) and report insights. These insights will be documented and reported in the form an article/paper that will be published.

The second part of the project is to potentially build a discovery tool that supports semantic search capabilities.

In the end, I would like if we can build applications that help with paper recommendations and trend analysis. 

If you are interested to be part of this project, please add your name as a contributor using the following [issue](https://github.com/dair-ai/arxiv_analysis/issues/1). For this particular project, I am looking for people that have experience working with a combinations of tools for data analysis and visualizations like Python, pandas, matplotlib, Kibana, and Elasticsearch. For the application development it would be helpful to know PyTorch or TensorFlow, serving models, and designing web applications. It is not required that you know all the tools, if you know of any other tools that experience will be useful and welcomed. Looking for experienced NLP/ML researchers, ML Engineers, Web Developers, and Data Scientists. As we will be working in a collaborative setting this is a good opportunity to learn from others as well.

The different stages of the project will be announced soon. 

More details coming soon. For now, please join us on our [Slack group](https://dairai.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-dv2dwzj7-F9HT047jIGkunNKv88lQ~g#/) (channel: project_arxiv_papers) for more announcements!
