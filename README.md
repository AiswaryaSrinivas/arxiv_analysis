# arXiv Dataset Analysis and Discovery Tools 

A project to help explore research papers and fuel new scientific discovery.

I am interested to put a team together of people that are interested in exploring this dataset and report insights.

The second part of the project is to potentially build a discovery tool that supports semantic search capabilities.

In the end, I would like if we can build applications that help with paper recommendations and trend analysis.
